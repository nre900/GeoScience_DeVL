    "Once we are happy with the quality of our time-series, the next step is to run magnetotelluric data processing. For this example, we will run the Bounded Influence, Remote Reference Processing (BIRRP) code of A.D. Chave and D.J. Thomsom. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those unfamiliar, the BIRRP program computes magnetotelluric and geomagnetic depth sounding response functions using a bounded influence, remote reference method, along with an implementation of the jackknife to get error estimates on the result. It incorporates a method for controlling leverage points (i.e., magnetic field values which are statistically anomalous), includes the implementation of two stage processing which enables removal of outliers in both the local electric and magnetic field variables, and allows multiple remote reference sites to be used. \n",

    " 4) The author will be notified of any possible coding errors that are encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5) The author will be informed of any improvements or additions that are made to BIRRP.\n",
