# GeoScience DeVL

The 2017-2018 Geoscience DEVL project aims to create the foundations for the AuScope 5 year plan for a Virtual Research Environment (AVRE) to better coordinate existing Australian geoscience eResearch infrastructures that have been built over the last decade in data, tools and Virtual Laboratories (VLs) through funding from AuScope, NeCTAR, ANDS, RDS, CSIRO, GA and several other sources.

One of the components to be added to the AVRE in the 2017-2018 DeVL project is the capability to store time series geophysical datasets with a focus on magnetotellurics (MT) data from the University of Adelaide. 

This repository contains tutorials on how to access and process MT data on NCI's Raijin supercomputer and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). Additional tutorials on converting MT time-series data into netCDF files and using OPENDAP services are presented.
